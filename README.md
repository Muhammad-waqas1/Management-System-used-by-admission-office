Additional Information
Object-Oriented Design
The system is designed using OOP principles, which enhance modularity, scalability, and code reusability. By encapsulating data and functionality into classes and objects, the program becomes more robust and easier to maintain.

File Handling
All student data, including personal information and academic records, is efficiently managed using file handling techniques. The use of .txt files ensures data persistence, allowing administrators to access and update information as needed.

User-Friendly Interface
The system features an intuitive user interface that simplifies navigation and operation. Whether you're adding new students, editing details, or generating reports, the interface is designed for ease of use, minimizing the learning curve for administrators.

Data Security
Protecting sensitive student information is paramount. The system incorporates robust security measures to safeguard data integrity and confidentiality. Access controls and encryption techniques ensure that only authorized personnel can view or modify student records.

Scalability
As the university grows and evolves, the management system can easily adapt to accommodate increasing numbers of students and expanding administrative needs. Its flexible architecture allows for seamless integration of new features and functionalities.
